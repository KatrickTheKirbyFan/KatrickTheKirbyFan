## hello 👋
I'm KatrickTheKirbyFan. I'm just a 14yo guy who makes speedy collabs, multirenders, random stuff, and more. I like keeping things chill (sometimes), trying out new ideas, experimenting with different styles, and just making whatever feels fun at the moment. I post some of my projects here on GitHub, mostly for fun and to share what I’ve been working on. Nothing too serious, just me doing my thing and enjoying it.
